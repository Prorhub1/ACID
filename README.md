Below is a simplified example of how you can implement ACID properties in a Python code snippet without comments:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
c = conn.cursor()

# Create table
c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users
             (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)''')

# Insert data
c.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)", ('Alice', 30))
c.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)", ('Bob', 25))

# Commit the transaction (A - Atomicity)
conn.commit()

# Retrieve data (C - Consistency)
c.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
print(c.fetchall())

# Update data (I - Isolation)
c.execute("UPDATE users SET age = 35 WHERE name = 'Alice'")
print("After update:")
c.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
print(c.fetchall())

# Rollback the transaction (D - Durability)
conn.rollback()

# Retrieve data after rollback
print("After rollback:")
c.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
print(c.fetchall())

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

In this code:

- We connect to an SQLite database and create a `users` table with columns `id`, `name`, and `age`.
- We insert some data into the table and commit the transaction to ensure atomicity.
- We retrieve the data to ensure consistency.
- We update some data and print it to demonstrate isolation. After the update, we rollback the transaction.
- After the rollback, we retrieve the data again to demonstrate durability.
- Finally, we close the database connection.

This is a basic example demonstrating the ACID properties in a database transaction. Depending on your requirements and the database system you're using, the implementation may vary.
